This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end medical diagnostic system capable
of detecting heart murmurs from raw audio recordings. By bridging the gap between healthcare and
Artificial Intelligence, trying to build a sophisticated Deep Learning solution that automates the early
screening of cardiac abnormalities. This system is designed to replace subjective manual listening
with objective, data-driven predictions using advanced audio analysis.
