This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end medical diagnostic system capable
of detecting heart murmurs from raw audio recordings. By bridging the gap between healthcare and
Artificial Intelligence, trying to build a sophisticated Deep Learning solution that automates the early
screening of cardiac abnormalities. This system is designed to replace subjective manual listening
with objective, data-driven predictions using advanced audio analysis.

Audio Data Fundamentals: Understanding audio data structures for machine learning.
Preprocessing: Mastering audio preprocessing techniques (resampling, duration fixing).
Feature Engineering: Performing feature extraction using MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients).
Data Handling: Implementing techniques for handling class imbalance in datasets.
Deep Learning: Training Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for sequence classification.
Deployment: Building and deploying web applications using Streamlit.
Model Management: Using Hugging Face Hub for model storage and versioning.
